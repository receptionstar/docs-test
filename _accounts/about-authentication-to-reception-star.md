# Logging in to Reception Star

## You can securely access your account's resources by authenticating to Reception Star, using different credentials depending on where you authenticate.


### About authentication to GitHub

To keep your account secure, you must authenticate before you can access certain resources on Reception Star. When you authenticate to Reception Star, you supply or confirm credentials that are unique to you to prove that you are exactly who you declare to be.

You can access your resources in Reception Star in a variety of ways: in the browser, or with the API. Each way of accessing Reception Star supports different modes of authentication.

- Username and password
- API key


### Authenticating in your browser

You can authenticate to Reception Star in your browser using Username and Password.

You'll create a password when you create your user account on Reception Star. We recommend that you use a password manager to generate a random and unique password. For more information, see ["Creating a strong password"](#creating-a-strong-password) below.


### Creating a strong password

Secure your Reception Star account with a strong and unique password using a password manager.

You must choose or generate a password for your GitHub account that is at least:

- Eight characters long, if it includes a number and a lowercase letter, or
- 15 characters long with any combination of characters

To keep your account secure, we recommend you follow these best practices:

- Use a password manager, such as [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) or [1Password](https://1password.com/), to generate a password of at least 15 characters.
- Generate a unique password for Reception Star. If you use your Reception Star password elsewhere and that service is compromised, then attackers or other malicious actors could use that information to access your Reception Star account.
<!-- - Configure two-factor authentication for your personal account. For more information, see ["About two-factor authentication"](#about-two-factor-authentication) below. -->
- Never share your password, even with a potential collaborator. Each person should use their own personal account on Reception Star. <!-- For more information on ways to collaborate, see: "Inviting collaborators to an account". -->

When you type a password to sign in, create an account, or change your password, Reception Star will check if the password you entered is considered weak according to datasets like HaveIBeenPwned. The password may be identified as weak even if you have never used that password before.

Reception Star only inspects the password at the time you type it, and never stores the password you entered in plaintext. For more information, see [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).

You can only use your password to log on to Reception Star using your browser. When you authenticate to Reception Star with other means, such as the API, you should use other credentials.

### About two-factor authenrication

For Reception Star, the second form of authentication is a code that's generated by an application on your mobile device. After you enable 2FA, Reception Star generates an authentication code any time someone attempts to sign into your Reception Star account. The only way someone can sign into your account is if they know both your password and have access to the authentication code on your phone.

You can also configure additional recovery methods in case you lose access to your two-factor authentication credentials.

We **strongly** urge you to enable 2FA for the safety of your account, not only on Reception Star, but on other websites and apps that support 2FA.

### Two-factor authentication recovery codes

When you configure two-factor authentication, you'll download and save your 2FA recovery codes. If you lose access to your phone, you can authenticate to Reception Star using your recovery codes.

Warning: For security reasons, Reception Star Support may not be able to restore access to accounts with two-factor authentication enabled if you lose your two-factor authentication credentials or lose access to your account recovery methods.


### Configuring two-factor authentication

A time-based one-time password (TOTP) application automatically generates an authentication code that changes after a certain period of time. We recommend using cloud-based TOTP apps such as:

- [1Password](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/)
- [Authy](https://authy.com/guides/github/)
- [LastPass Authenticator](https://lastpass.com/auth/)
- [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator/)

Tip: To configure authentication via TOTP on multiple devices, during setup, scan the QR code using each device at the same time. If 2FA is already enabled and you want to add another device, you must re-configure 2FA from your security settings.

1. Download a TOTP app.

2. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**.

3. In the left sidebar, click **Account security**. 

4. Under "Two-factor authentication", click **Enable two-factor authentication**. 

5. Under "Two-factor authentication", select **Set up using an app** and click **Continue**.

6. Under "Authentication verification", do one of the following: 

    - Scan the QR code with your mobile device's app. After scanning, the app displays a six-digit code that you can enter on GitHub.

    - If you can't scan the QR code, click e**nter this text code** to see a code that you can manually enter in your TOTP app instead. 

7. The TOTP mobile application saves your Reception Star account and generates a new authentication code every few seconds. On Reception Star, type the code into the field under "Enter the six-digit code from the application". If your recovery codes are not automatically displayed, click **Continue**.

8. Under "Save your recovery codes", click **Download** to download your recovery codes to your device. Save them to a secure location because your recovery codes can help you get back into your account if you lose access. 

9. After saving your two-factor recovery codes, click **I have saved my recovery codes** to enable two-factor authentication for your account.

10. After you've saved your recovery codes and enabled 2FA, we recommend you sign out and back in to your account. In case of problems, such as a forgotten password or typo in your email address, you can use recovery codes to access your account and correct the problem.


### Configuring two-factor authentication recovery methods

In addition to securely storing your two-factor authentication recovery codes, we strongly recommend configuring one or more additional recovery methods.


#### Downloading your two-factor authentication recovery codes

When you configure two-factor authentication, you'll download and save your 2FA recovery codes. If you lose access to your phone, you can authenticate to Reception Star using your recovery codes. You can also download your recovery codes at any point after enabling two-factor authentication.

To keep your account secure, don't share or distribute your recovery codes. We recommend saving them with a secure password manager, such as:

- 1Password
- LastPass

If you generate new recovery codes or disable and re-enable 2FA, the recovery codes in your security settings automatically update.

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**. 

2. In the left sidebar, click **Account security**.

3. Next to "Recovery codes," click **Show**. 

4. Save your recovery codes in a safe place. Your recovery codes can help you get back into your account if you lose access. 

    - To save your recovery codes on your device, click **Download**.
    - To save a hard copy of your recovery codes, click **Print**.
    - To copy your recovery codes for storage in a password manager, click **Copy**.


#### Generating a new set of recovery codes

Once you use a recovery code to regain access to your account, it cannot be reused. If you've used all 16 recovery codes, you can generate another list of codes. Generating a new set of recovery codes will invalidate any codes you previously generated.

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**. 

2. In the left sidebar, click **Account security**.

3. Next to "Recovery codes," click **Show**.

4. To create another batch of recovery codes, click **Generate new recovery codes**.

1. Visit https://my.receptionstar.com/password_reset to reset your password.

2. Enter the email address associated with your Reception Star account, then click **Send password reset email**. The email will be sent to the backup email address if you have one configured.

<!-- 4. If you have enabled two-factor authentication, you will be prompted for your 2FA credentials. Type your 2FA credentials or one of your 2FA recovery codes and click Verify. -->

5. Type a new password, confirm your new password, and click **Change password**.


### Changing an existing password

When you type a password to sign in, create an account, or change your password, Recepiton Star will check if the password you entered is considered weak according to datasets like HaveIBeenPwned. The password may be identified as weak even if you have never used that password before.
